Golint is a linter for Go source code.

This is forked from http://github.com/golang/lint and has the following alterations:

* Defaults to linting current directory if no arguments are supplied
* Removed all checks for documentation
* Removed all initialism checks
* Removed error string checks
* Ignores any source files in a proto directory (since this is used for autogenerated source files by protoc-gen-go)

To install, run:
  go get github.com/iand/lint/golint

To use, type:
  golint

or:
  golint <directory or file>  

See http://github.com/golang/lint for more documentation
